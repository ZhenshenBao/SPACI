# SPACI
Function frequencyw is used to calculate the weight of the frequency of genes appeared in different pathways.
Function SPACI is used to do the SPACI method to identify significant pathways.
Function edgesr is used to compute the strength variations of interactions between genes comapred with two different conditions in all signaling pathways.
The example can be seen in the file example.r.
